Heart Disease Prediction
This is a machine learning project that predicts whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on various medical features. The model uses a dataset to classify patients into two categories: having heart disease or not.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease. The dataset used for this model contains medical features like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. We used a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression) to predict whether the patient has heart disease.

The project includes:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
Model training: Using a machine learning algorithm to train the model.
Evaluation: Measuring the performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Pandas: For data manipulation.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook (optional): For running and experimenting with the code interactively.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various health-related features of patients, which are used to predict whether they have heart disease.

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.
It consists of 14 columns:
age: Age of the patient.
sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female).
cp: Chest pain type.
trestbps: Resting blood pressure.
chol: Serum cholesterol.
fbs: Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true, 0 = false).
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results.
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.
exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).
oldpeak: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
thal: Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect).
target: Target variable (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease).
Model Implementation
Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset using Pandas.
Handle missing values (if any).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, chest pain types).
Normalize continuous features (e.g., age, cholesterol).
Model Building:

Train a machine learning model using the processed data (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
How to Run the Code
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
Install the required dependencies (if not already installed):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the code:

bash
Copy code
python heart_disease_prediction.py
This will execute the heart disease prediction model, display the evaluation metrics, and output predictions based on the input features.

Results
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model.
Precision: The precision of the model for predicting heart disease.
Recall: The recall of the model for predicting heart disease.
F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
